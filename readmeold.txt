srshud_600 is for 800x600 users (like myself).

Plain old srshud is for everyone else.

I've included different versions of scoreboard.res for non-600 users; choose the file that corresponds to your
vertical resolution and rename it to scoreboard.res (you can delete, rename, move, etc. the default scoreboard.res file).

I've also included hudmedicharge_800+.res, which should fix a minor issue for vertical resolutions 800 or higher.

Need more help? Switch to ellshud. It's better.

Thanks to ell, Fog, whayay, omni, and Rawr for copy-paste/inspiration.
